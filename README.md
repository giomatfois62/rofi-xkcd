# rofi-xkcd
rofi-xkcd is a rofi menu made to browse, download and view xkcd comics.
The list of all comics is downloaded by the *scrape_xkcd.py* script and then showed in a rofi menu by the *rofi-xkcd.sh* script.
Selecting an entry will download the corresponding comic image and display within rofi.
All downloaded comics are locally cached in the *~/HOME/.cache/xkcd_cache* folder for future views.
